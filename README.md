# Watson Discovery News Crypto Sentiment Analysis

In this example, we will use Watson Discovery News in order to query articles written about Bitcoin and visualize the sentiment of the articles. This should act as a baseline for integrating Watson Discovery into your own application. The use cases are endless, with Watson Discovery, and especially the "news" collection, you can harness the power of advanced queries in order to gain many insights.

# Flow
1. User signs up for IBM Cloud
1. User creates an instance of Watson Discovery
1. User creates new Watson Studio project with Jupyter Notebook
1. The output of Watson Discovery News query is used in Jupyter Notebook to visualize the data

# Included Components

* [Watson Studio](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/)
* [Watson Discovery](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/discovery/)

# Featured Technologies

* [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

# Steps to Follow

## Sign up for Watson Studio

Sign up for IBM's [Watson Studio](https://dataplatform.ibm.com). After signing in, create a new, **basic** project â€“ give it a name, and create a new object storage service if prompted (the **lite** option will work fine).

## Allocate Discovery service

Head over to [IBM Cloud](http://bluemix.net/), if prompted, login with the same credentials as above. From the dashboard, click **Create Resource** and search for "*Discovery*" in the catalog. Click on the Discovery card, and click **Create**.

## Create Notebook

From Watson Studio, navigate to the project you created previously.
1. In the `Assets` tab, select the `Create notebook` option.
1. Select the `From URL` tab.
1. Enter a name for the notebook.
1. Optionally, enter a description for the notebook.
1. Enter this Notebook URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/crypto-discovery-news-sentiment-analysis/master/notebooks/crypto-analysis.ipynb

## Run the notebook

Once the notebook has been created, navigate to the cell with Watson Discovery credentials and enter your own. To find your credentials, navigate to your Discovery service, click on the menu item labeled *Credentials*, generate a new set if none exists yet. Now, you can run the notebook and analyze the results.
